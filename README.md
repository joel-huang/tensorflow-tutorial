Learning and experimenting with Tensorflow.

# Log
* 16 Dec 2017 - `01-tensors.py` - Learnt about placeholders, variables, running basic sessions, constructing a basic linear model.
* 16 Dec 2017 - `02-optimizers.py` - Use optimizers to train the models by iteratively running training sessions.
* 17 Dec 2017 - `03-estimator.py` - Using estimators as a quick and dirty way to `train` and `evaluate` a model.
* 21 Dec 2017 - `04-linear-model.py` - Running a stochastic gradient descent with variable batch and step size on MNIST test and training sets. Plotting of results in a coherent manner using `matplotlib` and using the confusion matrix from `scikit-learn` to understand mis-classifications.
